# Draw It or Lose It - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
**Client:** The Gaming Room  
**Project Aim:** Develop a web-based version of the Android game "Draw It or Lose It," ensuring cross-platform functionality and a seamless user experience.

## Software Requirements
The client required a game that supports multiple teams and players, with unique game and team names. The game must manage only one instance in memory at any given time to prevent conflicts and maintain data integrity across distributed environments.

## What I Did Well
I excelled in creating the requirements and design constraints based on the provided information. This foundational work was critical in shaping the project's direction and ensuring all technical and user needs were addressed efficiently.

## Process Benefits
Working through the design document proved invaluable for structuring the development process. It compelled me to thoroughly understand and plan each component's functionality and interaction, which streamlined coding and troubleshooting.

## Areas for Revision
If I were to revise one part of the document, it would be the section on development requirements. Further refinement here could better align the project's technical execution with strategic business goals, enhancing overall project coherence and application performance.

## User Needs Interpretation
Interpreting user needs was central to the design process. By focusing on user requirements such as ease of access and engaging gameplay across multiple platforms, I ensured the design was user-centric, which enhanced user satisfaction and engagement.

## Design Approach
My approach was methodical, beginning with a clear definition of requirements and constraints. Going forward, I would incorporate more iterative testing phases early in the development cycle to better adapt to changing requirements and user feedback.

## Future Strategies
For future projects, I plan to focus on modular design and microservices architecture to enhance adaptability and ease maintenance. Additionally, employing automated testing and continuous integration strategies will ensure a more robust and error-resistant deployment.

## Conclusion
This project not only tested my technical abilities but also deepened my understanding of strategic software design. It highlighted the importance of aligning technical solutions with user-centric design principles to deliver a product that is both functional and engaging.
